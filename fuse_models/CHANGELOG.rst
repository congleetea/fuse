0.2.0 (2019-07-12)
------------------
* Get predict_to_current_time ROS param (`#17 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/17>`_)
* [RST-2202] Catch potential errors when computing the covariances (`#18 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/18>`_)
  * Clear the covariance on error
* Remove angles header not used (`#16 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/16>`_)
* Default to private ~reset and ~set_pose names (`#14 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/14>`_)
* Depend on sensor_msgs and nav_msgs (`#15 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/15>`_)
* Depend on libceres-dev instead of ceres-solver (`#11 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/11>`_)
  * Depend on libceres-dev instead of ceres-solver
  * Add missed depend on angles
* Resolve names before subscribing (`#10 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/10>`_)
* Linter/style changes
* Use std::bind instead of std::bind2nd
  std::bind2nd is marked as deprecated in C++11
  Co-Authored-By: Stephen Williams <stephen.vincent.williams@gmail.com>
* Add sensor_proc test
  Only for:
  * mergeIndices
  * appendPartialMeasurement
* Fix appendPartialMeasurement by merging indices
  Position and orientation indices are merged together into a single
  std::vector<size_t> of indices, applying the appropriate offset to the
  orientation indices.
  This is passed to appendPartialMeasurement, which should be called only
  once. It doesn't need the base_index and offset args anymore.
* [RST-2128] fuse rl ignition sensor (`#6 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/6>`_)
* [RST-2144] Updated macro calls on all objects to support proper Eigen memory alignment (`#8 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/8>`_)
* Bug in motion model history (`#7 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/7>`_)
* Use linear indices for linear velocity (`#5 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/5>`_)
  Not angular indices, which is wrong and produces a crash at runtime
  because an assert fails.
* Fix appendPartialMeasurement assignments (`#4 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/4>`_)
* Store ros::Subscriber in sensor model attribute (`#3 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/3>`_)
  Store ros::Subscriber in sensor model attribute
* Tailor: Creating Jenkinsfile
* Adding base_link_output_frame_id to the 2D odom publisher (`#1 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse_rl/issues/1>`_)
