* Depend on libceres-dev instead of ceres-solver (`#71 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/71>`_)
* Return variable UUID by const reference (`#69 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/69>`_)
* Added a default implementation for the type() method (`#67 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/67>`_)
* [RST-2144] Support proper Eigen memory alignment (`#65 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/65>`_)
* [RST-2128] Added a "reset" service to the fixed lag smoother (`#61 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/61>`_)
* Modified Variable class to make the UUID immutable (`#55 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/55>`_)
* [RST-1960] Added a tangent/parameter space flag to the covariance function (`#50 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/50>`_)
* Some minor header cleanup of fuse_core (`#51 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/51>`_)

0.3.0 (2019-03-18)
------------------
* [RST-1653] transaction stamps (`#37 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/37>`_)
  * Moved the set<ros::Time> object that always accompanies a Transaction into the Transaction itself.
  * Updated all related classes to support that change

* Contributors: Gary Servin, Stephen Williams

0.1.1 (2018-08-15)
------------------

0.1.0 (2018-08-12)
------------------
* [RST-1121] move optimizers (`#25 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/25>`_)
  * Added a clone() method to the Transaction object
  * Changed optimizer to unique ownership of the graph. This better captures the usage.
